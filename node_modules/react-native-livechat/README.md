npm install react-native-livechat --save
```

### Chat Bubble

Chat bubble is a small view that by default is blue and is placed on bottom-right side of your screen.

1. Can can control position of bubble by simply sending **bubbleLeft** and **bubbleTop** props.

*Example:*
```javascript
<LiveChat bubbleLeft={0} bubbleTop={0} license={your_license_id} />
```

2. By default bubble component is draggable and movable. You can disable this option by sending **movable** prop with *false* value.

*Example:*
```javascript
<LiveChat movable={false} license={your_license_id} />
```

3. If would like to change color of bubble you can simply pass **bubbleColor** prop with LiveChat component.

*Example:*
```javascript
<LiveChat bubbleColor='red' license={your_license_id} />
```

4. If you don't like appearance of this bubble at all, you can send **bubble** prop with your own component.

*Example: *
```javascript
<LiveChat license={your_license_id}
  bubble={
  <View style={{ width: 60, height: 60, backgroundColor: 'green' }} />
  }
/>
```

### Chat Appearance

This module uses [react-native-gifted-chat](https://github.com/FaridSafi/react-native-gifted-chat) for chat UI.

You can customise your chat appearance by sending props to LiveChat component like you would normally send them to GiftedChat component.

For example if you would like to control **onPressAvatar** to show info about agent, you can do it like this:

*Example:*
```javascript
<LiveChat license={your_license_id}
  onPressAvatar={ info => console.warn(info) } />
```

*You can find information about all props here: [react-native-gifted-chat](https://github.com/FaridSafi/react-native-gifted-chat).*

### LiveChat Visitor SDK
This module uses LiveChat Visitor SDK.

*You can find more information about available methods [here](https://github.com/FaridSafi/react-native-gifted-chat).*

To use all methods you must create LiveChat reference.

You can do it like this:
```javascript
<LiveChat onLoaded={ ref => this.livechat = ref } 
	license={your_license_id}/>
```

Let's say you want to close current chat. You can do it in two ways:
```javascript
 this.livechat.closeChat();
 // is the same as:
 GLOBAL.visitorSDK.closeChat();
```

*Table of all available methods:*
